# Message Relay

## What is this?

This is a Discord bot written in Python with the purpose of forwarding messages to services as desired. For my usecase, I would like to send messages to an n8n webhook that I will be configuring. However, you could clone this and have a Discord bot send messages to wherever you require!

## Prerequisites

 - Python
 - Docker
 - Discord API key
 - Poetry Python Package Manager
